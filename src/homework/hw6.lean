Assignment: read (at least skim) the Sections 1 and 2 of 
the Wikipedia page on set identities: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_set_identities_and_relations 
There, , among *many* other facts, you will find definitions 
of left and right distributivity. To complete the remainder
of this assignment, you need to understand what it means for 
one operator to be left- (or right-) distributive over another.
