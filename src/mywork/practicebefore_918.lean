/- Hey everyone!-/

/-Here I'll summarize and put practice problems for retaining
the material from the past three weeks because there was definitely a lot to work with!-/

Reasoning:

Inductive, Abductive, Deductive

Inductive: 

-derive generalized predictive models from
given sets of observations, use a reasonable form of model
(often linear, y = mx+b)
-calibrate m and b coefficients to get a minimum-error fit of 
line to data
Is this form of reasoning *sound* or *not sound*
