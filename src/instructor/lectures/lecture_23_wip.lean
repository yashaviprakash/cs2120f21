ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES OF RELATIONS

namespace relations

section relation

/-
Define relation, r, as two-place predicate on 
a type, β, with notation, x ≺ y, for (r x y). 
-/
variables {α β : Type}  (r : β → β → Prop)
local infix `≺`:50 := r  

-- special relations on an arbitrary type, α 
def empty_relation := λ a₁ a₂ : α, false
def full_relation := λ a₁ a₂ : α, true -- every pair satisfies true
def id_relation :=  λ a₁ a₂ : α, a₁ = a₂  -- is this a subset relation?

-- Analog of the subset relation but now on binary relations
-- Note: subrelation is a binary relation on binary relations
def subrelation (q r : β → β → Prop) := ∀ ⦃x y⦄, q x y → r x y -- if any pair that is related in q is also related in r


/-
Commonly employed properties of relations
-/

def total := ∀ x y, x ≺ y ∨ y ≺ x -- for any pair x and y, x must point to y or y must point to x
/-
Note: we will use "total" later to refer to a different
property of relations that also satisfy the constraints
needed to be "functions."

/-
Is antireflexive the same is not reflexive?

reflexive = every object is related ot itself
not reflexive = not every object is related to itself

is that the same as saying every object is not related to itself?
no, it's not the same

an example: less than 
-/

def anti_reflexive := ∀ x, ¬ x ≺ x -- example: less than
def irreflexive := anti_reflexive r -- sometimes used, typically means the same, but sometimes defined differently
def anti_symmetric := ∀ ⦃x y⦄, x ≺ y → y ≺ x → x = y -- example: less than or equal to
def asymmetric := ∀ ⦃x y⦄, x ≺ y → ¬ y ≺ x -- example: less than or greater than

-- Exercises:
/-
- Name a common anti_symmetric relation in arithmetic
- Name a common asymmetric relation in arithmetic
-/

-- symmetric does not imply totality, but totality does imply symmetry
example : reflexive r → ¬ asymmetric r := _   -- true?
example : ¬ reflexive r ↔ irreflexive r := _  -- true?

provide formal definition of each of the following properties of a binary relation, 
r, on objects of a type, β. We will call r 

– a quasiordering if r is reflexive and transitive;
– a strict (or sharp) ordering if r is irreflexive and transitive;
– a near-ordering if r is anti_symmetic and transitive;
– a (reflexive) ordering if r is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive;
– a tolerance if r is reflexive and symmetric;
– * an equivalence if r is reflexive, symmetric and transitive

def ordering := reflexive r ∧ transitive r ∧ anti_symmetric r -- new
def strict_ordering := asymmetric r ∧ transitive r
def partial_order := reflexive r ∧ anti_symmetric r ∧ transitive r ∧ ¬ total r
def total_order := reflexive r ∧ anti_symmetric r ∧ transitive r ∧ total r

/-
Definitions vary subtly. Be sure you know what is meant by these terms in any
given setting or application.
