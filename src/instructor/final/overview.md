### Reading and writing

Be able to take propositions expressed in English and express them formally in the language of predicate logic, and take propositions expressed formally in predicate logic and explain in English what claims they are making. It is a major expectation of this class that when you are done you will be able to read, write, and understand predicate logic, and translate between it and English. Good examples to revisit to test your ability to read predicate logic are (1) the definition of a well-ordering, and (2) the induction principle for the natural number type (nat).

### Basic reasoning principles

Know all the introduction and elimination rules for all predicate logic connectives and quantifiers, and when, why, and how to use them in constructing larger proofs. The need for you to be competent at the level of the basic logical reasoning principles has been made clear all semester long.

### Proving theorems

Axioms are logical propositions accepted that are accepted as true, and thus as having proofs, without any further conditions. Theorems are truths that are derived, directly or indirectly, from axioms. Axioms are true by assumption. Theorems are true because proofs have been given. For example, the reflexive property of equality is an axiom, while its reflexivity, transitivity, and equivalence properties are proved as theorems. What each proof shows is that as long as the axioms of reflexivity and substitutivity axioms (the first the introduction rule, the second the elimination rule) are accepted, the relation must also be symmetric, transitive, and and equivalence relation.

From there, we went on to prove many theorems that express basic truths about predicate logic itself. For example, from the one introduction and two elimination axioms for "and" we went on to prove that "and" is commutative. Conceptually the proof says that you can always take a proof of P /\ Q, derive a proof of P, derive a proof of Q, and from these proofs, derive a proof of Q /\ P.

We spent quite a lot of time learning the introduction and elimination rules for *all* of the connectives and quantifiers of predicate logic, but also how to use them in developing proofs of much more complex theorems. A major expectation of this class is that you will be able to demonstrate proficiency in using this knowledge to prove theorems from conjectures that you haven't seen before, potentially involving any of the connectives and quantifiers.

This semester you also learned that "proof strategies" such as "proof by induction" or "proof by contradiction" are just applications of specific reasoning principles. For example, proof by contradiction is the application of (classical) negation elimination.   You are expected to know clearly what are meant, and what *specific* reasoning principles are involved in, proof by induction, proof by negation, and proof by contradiction, and you should be able to construct formally and present informally (in English) proofs producing using and/all of these "strategies."
